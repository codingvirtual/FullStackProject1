# FullStackProject1
Project 1 from Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree. Simple single-page display of several movies with ability to click for
the trailer. This initial project is designed to help the learner get comfortable with the basic syntax and structure
of Python code as well as a gentle introductio to object-oriented programming.

The project simply displays a single web page with the movie posters for 6 pre-defined movies (hard-coded into
the programming). Upon clicking a movie poster, the user is able to watch the Youtube trailer associated with that
movie.
